# TremTec Agent Workflows

This document has been reorganized into individual workflow files for easier navigation and selective loading by LLMs.

See the [`workflows/`](./workflows/) directory for individual workflow documents.

## How to Use

LLMs should load the specific workflow file that matches the task:

```
Load: workflows/new-product.md
Load: workflows/new-feature.md
Load: workflows/bug-fix.md
Load: workflows/board-meetings.md
```

For complete workflow index and descriptions, see [`workflows/index.md`](./workflows/index.md).
